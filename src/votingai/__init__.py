"""
VotingAI - Democratic Consensus System for AI Agent Teams

A comprehensive, production-ready voting system for AI agent teams with
advanced enhancements, adaptive consensus mechanisms, and enterprise security.

Refactored Architecture:
- core: Fundamental voting protocols and base implementations
- consensus: Advanced adaptive consensus and deliberation algorithms
- intelligence: Semantic interpretation and natural language processing
- security: Cryptographic integrity, audit, and Byzantine fault tolerance
- research: Benchmarking, evaluation, and advanced testing frameworks
- utilities: Configuration management and common utilities
