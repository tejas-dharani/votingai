- **`core`** - Fundamental voting protocols and base implementations
- **`consensus`** - Advanced consensus algorithms and deliberation strategies  
- **`intelligence`** - Semantic interpretation and natural language processing
- **`security`** - Cryptographic integrity, audit, and Byzantine fault tolerance

- **`research`** - Benchmarking, evaluation, and experimental analysis

## 🎯 Quick Start

VotingAI supports both **OpenAI** and **Anthropic (Claude)** — swap providers with one line.

```python
import asyncio
from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent
from autogen_agentchat.conditions import MaxMessageTermination

from votingai import BaseVotingGroupChat, VotingMethod, ModelProvider, create_model_client

async def main():
    # OpenAI (uses OPENAI_API_KEY env var)
    model_client = create_model_client(ModelProvider.OPENAI, model="gpt-4o")

    # Anthropic / Claude (uses ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env var) — drop-in swap:
    # model_client = create_model_client(ModelProvider.ANTHROPIC, model="claude-opus-4-6")
    
    # Create voting agents
    agents = [
        AssistantAgent("Alice", model_client, system_message="Expert in backend systems"),
        AssistantAgent("Bob", model_client, system_message="Frontend specialist"), 
        AssistantAgent("Carol", model_client, system_message="Security expert")
    ]
    
    # Create voting team
    voting_team = BaseVotingGroupChat(
        participants=agents,
        voting_method=VotingMethod.MAJORITY,
        require_reasoning=True,
        max_discussion_rounds=2,
        termination_condition=MaxMessageTermination(20)
    )
    
    # Run voting process
    result = await voting_team.run(task="""
        Proposal: Should we migrate our API from REST to GraphQL?
        
        Please vote APPROVE or REJECT with detailed reasoning.
    """)
    
    print(f"Decision: {result}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## 📋 Use Cases

### 1. Code Review Voting 👨‍💻

Perfect for collaborative code reviews with multiple reviewers:

```python
# Qualified majority voting for code reviews
voting_team = BaseVotingGroupChat(
    participants=[senior_dev, security_expert, performance_engineer],
    voting_method=VotingMethod.QUALIFIED_MAJORITY,
    qualified_majority_threshold=0.67,  # Require 2/3 approval
    require_reasoning=True
)

task = """
Proposal: Approve merge of PR #1234 - "Add Redis caching layer"

Code changes implement memory caching to reduce database load.
Please review for: security, performance, maintainability.

Vote APPROVE or REJECT with detailed reasoning.
"""
```

### 2. Architecture Decisions 🏗️

Use ranked choice voting for complex architectural decisions:

```python
# Ranked choice for architecture decisions
voting_team = BaseVotingGroupChat(
    participants=[tech_lead, architect, devops_engineer],
    voting_method=VotingMethod.RANKED_CHOICE,
    max_discussion_rounds=3
)

task = """
Proposal: Choose microservices communication pattern

Options:
1. REST APIs with Service Mesh
2. Event-Driven with Message Queues  
3. GraphQL Federation
4. gRPC with Load Balancing

Provide ranked preferences with reasoning.
"""
```

### 3. Content Moderation 🛡️

Majority voting for content approval/rejection:

```python
# Simple majority for content moderation
voting_team = BaseVotingGroupChat(
    participants=[community_manager, safety_specialist, legal_advisor],
    voting_method=VotingMethod.MAJORITY,
    allow_abstentions=True,
    max_discussion_rounds=1
)
```

### 4. Feature Prioritization 📈

Unanimous consensus for high-stakes decisions:

```python
# Unanimous voting for feature prioritization
voting_team = BaseVotingGroupChat(
    participants=[product_manager, engineering_lead, ux_designer],
    voting_method=VotingMethod.UNANIMOUS,
    max_discussion_rounds=4
)
```
